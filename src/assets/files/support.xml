      <que>Who is QuickEnrollment Inc?</que>
      <ans>QuickEnrollment was established in September 1999 and operates out of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. QuickEnrollment Inc. provides online registration solutions particularly, but not exclusively, to amateur and recreational sports organizations, their respective leagues and the tournaments they run. Our expertise and knowledge in this area has allowed us to become registration specialists, thereby providing our clients with the best online registration solution in the industry.
      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      QuickEnrollment has essentially automated the traditional paper-based registration process that currently exists in amateur and recreational sports by leveraging state-of-the-art Internet based tools and technologies in creating the QE Online Registration Management System. We provide online registration solutions to address the registration needs in three key areas of amateur sport: League Registration, Tournament Registration and Event Registration (e.g. Clinics, Recertification Courses)</ans>
